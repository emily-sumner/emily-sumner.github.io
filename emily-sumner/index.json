Sarnecka, Mark Steyvers, and Celeste Kidd.\nImagine that it’s your second day at a new job. You are standing at the coffee cart outside your office building, considering the unfamiliar menu. Yesterday you had a cappuccino and enjoyed it; today you must decide whether to get the cappuccino again like yesterday, or try the matcha green tea latte, which you might not like. This is known as an explore/exploit problem, because you must choose between exploiting a familiar option (the cappuccino) or exploiting a new one (the matcha latte). We used two different explore-exploit paradigms with children (see photos below). We found that children didn’t play in a way that maximized payout and explored more than would be optimal. However, children correctly identified the machines with the highest level of payout and overwhelmingly preferred this bandit. We found that adults played in a way that maximized payout when they were told to maximize payout or were given no explicit instructions. However, when adults were asked to maximize learning, they explore more \u0026ndash; like children.\n  ","date":1556348400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556348400,"objectID":"4c56c23296bbf58c41aa2d5c46fa9a18","permalink":"/emily-sumner/project/bandit/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/emily-sumner/project/bandit/","section":"project","summary":"We show that children are more explorative than adults on bandit tasks.","tags":["CogDev","JDM"],"title":"Exploration during childhood","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With Ashley J.

This is particularly difficult in early childhood, for children who are prelinguistic or are just beginning to speak their first words. In this stage, children’s responses are commonly measured by presenting young children with a limited choice between one of a small number of options (e.g., “Do you want X or Y?”). A tendency to choose one response in these tasks may be taken as an indication of a child’s preference or understanding. Adults’ responses are known to exhibit order biases when they are asked questions. The current set of experiments looks into the following question: do children demonstrate response biases? Together, we show that (1) toddlers demonstrate a robust verbal recency bias when asked “or” questions in a lab-based task and a naturalistic corpus of caretaker-child speech interactions, (2) the recency bias weakens with age, and (3) the recency bias strengthens as the syllable-length of the choices gets longer. Taken together, these results indicate that children show a different type of response bias than adults, recency instead of primacy. Further, the results may suggest that this bias stems from increased constraints on children’s working memory.\n  ","date":1556348400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556348400,"objectID":"d9f55ca192467c76dff7f05f49249500","permalink":"/emily-sumner/project/recency/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/emily-sumner/project/recency/","section":"project","summary":"We show that toddlers and young children demonstrate a recency bias when answering questions verbally.","tags":["CogDev","JDM","Lang"],"title":"Recency biases in young children","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With Susanne Jaeggi, Barbara W. Sarnecka, Ryan Stokes, and Percy Mistry\nLife is full of decisions about when to play it safe and when to take risks. These decisions can be as mundane as deciding whether to try a new cereal or as paramount as choosing between alternative treatments for a life-threatening disease. In adults, risk-taking behavior is associated with many undesirable behaviors such as substance abuse, gambling etc. However, little is known about the development of an individual’s propensity for risk. Specifically, there are no standardized laboratory procedures that assess young children’s risk-taking preferences. In this line of work, we created and validated a measure of risk propensity. The Child Risk Utility Measure (CRUM) is a touchscreen application which enables us to assess individual differences in young children’s risk propensity. The CRUM respects the cognitive limitations of three- to six-year-old children. In this task, children try to help Cookie Monster take cookies from a cookie jar without Oscar waking up. However, the chances of Oscar waking up increase along with the number of cookies on the plate. We used this, along with other child-friendly measures of executive function to investigate the relationship of risk propensity, working memory, and inhibitory control.\n  ","date":1556348400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556348400,"objectID":"7c7329e1d018a28a9504db75f189f90e","permalink":"/emily-sumner/project/tablet/","publishdate":"2019-04-27T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/emily-sumner/project/tablet/","section":"project","summary":"We built child-friendly measures of executive function and risk propensity.","tags":["CogDev","JDM","Games"],"title":"Tablet measures of executive function","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"With Grace Lin, Angelica Sheen, Roldan Melcon, and Susanne Jaeggi\nThe greatest challenge of developing a measure of risk propensity is creating a game that feels real.

Although this is certainly true during the earliest stages of phonological development, once a child possesses the basic articulatory skills required for imitation, it need not necessarily be the case. A child could produce a word without possessing the fully formed lexical representation through imitation. In some cases, such as in response to questions containing fixed choices, this behavior could be mistaken for a deeper understanding of the words’ semantic content. In this paper, we present evidence that 2- to 3-year-old children exhibit a robust recency bias when verbally responding to two-alternative choice questions (i.e., they select the second, most recently mentioned option), possibly due to the availability of the second word in phonological memory. We find further evidence of this effect outside of a laboratory setting in naturalistic conversational contexts in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000), a large corpus of transcribed child-adult interactions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Toddlers Always Get The Last Word: Recency biases in early verbal behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emily Sumner","Robert Ford"],"categories":null,"content":" Supplementary notes can be added here, including code and math.
