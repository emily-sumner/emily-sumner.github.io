abstract: Imagine that it's your second day at a new job. You are standing at the coffee cart outside your office building, considering the unfamiliar menu. Yesterday you had a cappuccino and enjoyed it; today you must decide whether to get the cappuccino again like yesterday, or try the matcha green tea latte, which you might not like. This is known as an explore-exploit problem, because you must choose between exploiting a familiar option (the cappuccino) or exploiting a new one (the matcha latte).  Such problems arise all the time, Do you buy the same brand of hiking boots you just wore out, or try a new style? Re-watch that Netflix movie that you enjoyed before, or try a new one? Researchers studying the explore-exploit problem in adults have traditionally defined a good decision as one that maximizes payout and minimizes cost. The problem is commonly operationalized in bandit tasks named after the 'one-armed bandit' (i.e., slot machines) found in casinos. In a bandit task, participants decide between two or more bandits, each of which has an unknown rate of reward. The goal of the task is to maximize return by using a combination of exploration and exploitation. Formally, the optimal strategy is to explore the different bandits just long enough to learn which one pays out best, and then switch to exploiting that one (Mehlhorn et al., 2015). Indeed, that’s what most adults do.  The explore-exploit problem has been widely investigated in many different contexts, including reinforcement learning, psychiatric populations, and animal behavior. The present studies asked, What about children? Very few studies have investigated how children approach explore-exploit tasks, and if they approach these tasks with similar strategies as adults do. The key question in this study is whether children follow similar strategies to adults and attempt to maximize payout. If we find that children do not maximize payout, what are the reasons for suboptimal performance? Are children viewing the task in the same way as adults? In Experiment 1, we conduct a simplified version of the bandit task with 159 children. In Experiment 2, we conducted the same bandit task used in Experiment 1 with adults and give them different motives, to learn or to win. In the bandit task, participants were presented with three "Mystery Machines," each with a different proportion of winning and losing balls. Winning balls contained a sticker that the child was allowed to take home;  losing balls contained no sticker. One box dispensed only winning balls, one dispensed only losing balls, and one alternated between winning and losing. Participants made 15 decisions between the machines. In Experiment 1, we found that children didn’t play in a way that maximized payout and explored more than would be optimal. However, children correctly identified the machines with the highest level of payout and overwhelmingly preferred this bandit. We also show that children's exploration is not random. For example, children moved across the bandits from left to right repeatedly, as if they were reading a book.  In Experiment 2, adults played in a way that maximized payout when they were told to maximize payout or were given no explicit instructions. However, when adults were asked to maximize learning, they explore more - like children. Together, these results suggest that children are more interested in exploring than exploiting, and a potential explanation for this is that children are trying to learn as much about the environment as they can. We hypothesize that this is because the optimal time to shift from exploring to exploiting depends on (A) how well you know the environment, and (B) how likely it is that the environment will change. When you don't know the environment well or the environment is likely to change, then more exploring is beneficial because it provides more information about all aspects of the environment (addressing Problem A) and it provides information that may be helpful if something in the environment changes (Problem B.) We hypothesize that children typically are in a situation where (A) is low and (B) is high, so they naturally explore, whereas adults know the environment better and also have fewer years left ahead of them, meaning that the amount of change they must prepare for is lower. Our results are consistent with the idea that children develop flexible knowledge through exploration and broader search (Gopnik et al., 2017). From a child's point of view, the world is constantly changing. It makes sense to prioritize gathering data rather than maximizing immediate payouts.
