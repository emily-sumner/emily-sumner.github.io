The greatest challenge of developing a measure of risk propensity is creating a game that feels real. In this line of work, we designed Shima: a virtual reality measure of risk propensity. The game Shima was developed as part of the 2017 Virtual Reality BrainJam Hackathon during the 2017 Games for Change Festival. In this game, you are a photographer on an island inhabited by new species of animals. Your goal is to get as close as you can to each animal and take their picture. The closer you get, the more points you get. But if you get too close, the animal gets scared and runs away. We are currently collecting data to validate this measure.
