With Ashley J. Thomas and Barbara W. Sarnecka

In this project (in progress), we're interested in how children expect people who are 'in charge' to act. So far we've looked at bullying (pushing someone down or stealing a cookie) and protecting (kicking an outsider out who pushes someone down or steals a cookie). Four- to 8-year-old children think that the person in charge is much more likely to 'kick someone out' than a person who isn't in charge, and older children think they're less likely to push someone down.
