Life is full of decisions about when to play it safe and when to take risks. These decisions can be as mundane as deciding whether to try a new cereal or as paramount as choosing between alternative treatments for a life-threatening disease. In adults, risk-taking behavior is associated with many undesirable behaviors such as substance abuse, gambling etc. However, little is known about the development of an individual’s propensity for risk. Specifically, there are no standardized laboratory procedures that assess young children’s risk-taking preferences. In this line of work, we created and validated a measure of risk propensity. The Child Risk Utility Measure (CRUM) is a touchscreen application which enables us to assess individual differences in young children’s risk propensity. The CRUM respects the cognitive limitations of three- to six-year-old children. In this task, children try to help Cookie Monster take cookies from a cookie jar without Oscar waking up. However, the chances of Oscar waking up increase along with the number of cookies on the plate. We used this, along with other child-friendly measures of executive function to investigate the relationship of risk propensity, working memory, and inhibitory control.
