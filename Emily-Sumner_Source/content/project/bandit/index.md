Imagine that it’s your second day at a new job. You are standing at the coffee cart outside your office building, considering the unfamiliar menu. Yesterday you had a cappuccino and enjoyed it; today you must decide whether to get the cappuccino again like yesterday, or try the matcha green tea latte, which you might not like. This is known as an explore/exploit problem, because you must choose between exploiting a familiar option (the cappuccino) or exploiting a new one (the matcha latte). We used two different explore-exploit paradigms with children (see photos below). We found that children didn’t play in a way that maximized payout and explored more than would be optimal. However, children correctly identified the machines with the highest level of payout and overwhelmingly preferred this bandit. We found that adults played in a way that maximized payout when they were told to maximize payout or were given no explicit instructions. However, when adults were asked to maximize learning, they explore more -- like children.
